Simple example app with UseCases, Service and Storage.

The storage UserDefaults, abstraced with Storage protocol.

See how Components are structured and shared along the whole app and how it's implemented Navigator Pattern with ModuleBuilders to build UIViewControllers.

Also, there are some test that shows you how you can override production dependencies with mocks.
